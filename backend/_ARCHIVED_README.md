# ⚠️ ARCHIVED — No Longer Used

This Express/MongoDB backend has been replaced by **Firebase** (Firestore + Auth) running directly on the frontend.

- **Date archived**: February 19, 2026
- **Replaced by**: `src/firebase.ts`, `src/services/firestore.ts`, `src/services/auth.ts`

If you need server-side logic (e.g., Razorpay payment verification, email sending), use **Firebase Cloud Functions**.
